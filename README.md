# NonShared

## Purpose

This repo demonstrates the proper use of hidden files. The `.env` file was added to the `.gitignore`.

## How to

To use this application, you must create a new `.env` file in the main directory and create a variable named `SECRET_KEY`.

Your `SECRET_KEY` can be whatever you'd like. For example:

```
SECRET_KEY=potatoes
```

## You MUST have a `SECRET_KEY` variable; otherwise, the application will error out!
